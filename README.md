# capy-programming-language

This is a custom programming language currently being developed by myself. It is transpiled to c++ then made to be an executatble based on the c++ code.

Syntax examples (variables):

$ string hi = "hi" + "there"
$ int number = 32104 - 30000 * 2
$ usign byte myByte = 100
$ char myChar = 'h'
